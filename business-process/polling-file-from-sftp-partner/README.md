# IBM Sterling File Gateway Scenarios

Polling a file from a SFTP Partner

In this scenario business needs to go out to a partner using SFTP Server and poll for a file with specific name or extension. Once file is found it needs to be delivered internally.

You can schedule this BP to run every 30 minutes to check for files.
